# Developer Documentation

The Mixer Developer Site uses Markdown files to generate the content on the site. By contributing to these files you'll be improving our Documentation.

## File Headers

The top portion of each file is a block of #[YAML](http://yaml.org/) this controls various settings about the pages. Be sure that this is valid YAML before committing. 

We'll be adding some tests to ensure valid yaml is used before PRs can be merged in due course.



WORK IN PROGRESS, contact rifox for more information.
