## Season 2 Tutorial Project
In this segment, we take a deeper dive in to what Season 2 offers for developers. Mike and Hutch continue with their Constellation project from last week, and start incorporating new things that were added in Season 2. To demonstrate some of the new capabilities, they build a simple UI that shows how many Skills were used within a channel.
