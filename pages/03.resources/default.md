Mixer Interactive enables viewers, also known as participants, to directly control the environment in and around streamer’s broadcasts by interacting with user interface controls. When a broadcast has interactivity enabled, controls appear beneath the video on the viewer’s screen. These controls dynamically change according to live events and update in response to different situations that occur within the broadcast.

Developers and producers can create interactive experiences which can run as a part of a game, entirely as a standalone application, or as a tool. These experiences are then used by broadcasters to make their broadcasts interactive.

When a viewer interacts with the controls, their input is sent directly to the experience, allowing the developers to see exactly who is interacting and what they are doing. This level of engagement allows for the creation of truly unique and interactive experiences that let viewers and broadcasters experience Mixer broadcasts on a whole new level.
