# MixPlay SDK Deprecation
With continued, great feedback from the community and after careful consideration, we have decided to end support for  the following MixPlay Game SDKs: Unity, Unreal Engine 4, C++, Python. Low latency interactivity will always be a core part of Mixer and going forward we’ll focus our resources on other platform features  and streamer created MixPlay experiences.

## What did you announce today?
We’re ending support for  the following MixPlay SDKs:
 - Unity
 - Unreal Engine 4
 - C++
- Python

These SDKs will continue to be available on our GitHub but we won’t ship further updates or changes to them.

We’ll continue to maintain and support other SDKs not mentioned within this list.

## Will games that use these SDKs break?
No, existing released titles that use these SDKs will not break but we won’t ship further updates or changes to them. You are welcome to continue using them.

## I’m working on a game that uses these SDKs, what should I do?
If you’re currently using our SDKs in your game, please continue to do so. If you have questions please reach out to our team via email.

## What does this mean for the future of MixPlay?
MixPlay isn’t going away, You can still use it to create interactive experiences on Mixer. We’re excited about the success of streamer customized MixPlay experiences and the tools and community that were created around them.

We believe there is more we can achieve with customizable interactivity.

## I have a question that is not answered here, what can I do?
Please [email us](mailto:mixerdevinfo@microsoft.com) and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.
