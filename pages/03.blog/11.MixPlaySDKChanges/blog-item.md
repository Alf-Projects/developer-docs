Low Latency interactivity has always been a core part of Mixer's vision and to aid in that Mixer developed and released a multitude of MixPlay SDKs and Libraries to enable you to build experiences and integrations that leveraged Mixer's MixPlay features.

The best MixPlay integrations have always been integrations created by and customized by our streamers. These integrations become an integral part to their streams often leading to a channel's community developing its own set of culture, jokes and games surrounding their use of the customized MixPlay available on those channels.

Our other integrations, in particular our Game SDKs(Unity, C++, Unreal) allow for truly innovative experiences within Games and we're very proud of their existence on Mixer. However we're unable to continue to support our Game SDKs with the care and attention that they need and as such we're going to make some adjustments to this space so that we're able to focus on our Streamer customized and created MixPlay.

## What's Happening?
We're deprecating the following MixPlay SDKs:
- Unity
- Unreal Engine 4
- C++

These SDKs will continue to be available on our GitHub but we won't be shipping further updates or changes to them.

All other SDKs will continue to be maintained and supported.

## Will Games that uses these SDKs break?
No, existing released titles that use these SDKs will not break, you are welcome to continue using them.

## I'm working on a Game that uses these SDKs what should I do?
If you're already using our SDKs in your game at the moment please continue to do so. If you have questions please reach out and [email us](mailto:mixerdevinfo@microsoft.com).

## What does this mean for the future of MixPlay?
MixPlay isn't going away and will continue to function, there are no API changes or deprecations coming with this change so you can still use it to create Interactive experiences on Mixer. We're very excited about the success of streamer customized MixPlay experiences and the tools and community that have been built around them.

We've also seen great success with allowing Mixer partners to customize their Skills by adding their own Custom Stickers to their channel and we at Mixer believe there is more we can achieve with customizable interactivity within Mixer.

## I have a question that is not answered here, what can I do?
Please [email us](mailto:mixerdevinfo@microsoft.com), we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
