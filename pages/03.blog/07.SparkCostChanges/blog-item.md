Hey Everyone, I have some exciting news. Early on in Season 2 we reported a change to MixPlay spark costing that required MixPlay users to move to a static list of MixPlay Costs, this was met with a strong reaction from you all of our developers.

After much discussion. We're now canceling this change. MixPlay costing will remain dynamic and flexible going into the future.

You can still read about this change here: https://dev.mixer.com/guides/season2/sparkcostchanges but I've added an alert to the top of the page stating it is cancelled and you do not need to action on it.
