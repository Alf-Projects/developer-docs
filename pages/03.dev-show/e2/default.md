## Sharing interactive projects with share codes

## Sample: Player Agency in Unity
In this tutorial we created a game with player agency for viewers on Mixer - basically we gave everyone watching a tank! We used the [Unity Tanks](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/tanks-tutorial) tutorial and made it so that it spawns a tank for each viewer - giving them individual control.
