Once you have enabled test streams for an account, it is enabled for every broadcast, across all devices. You don't need to enable test streams for each device you broadcast from. There is one, global setting applied to the account.

! Please note, when viewing a test stream on our mobile apps, only MixPlay will show. The video feed will not appear.

## Controlling Access
Whilst in test stream mode there are two ways to grant viewers access to view your test stream.

* By Making them a moderator in the channel - Moderators of your channel can see your test streams
* By Sharing out the access key link - At the top of your channel page whilst streaming in test stream mode is a banner which has a link in it. You can give this link out and those with the link will be able to access your test stream. This link resets for every stream.

## Example Access Key Link

Here's an example of a test stream access link. You can see the channel name in the same way a regular channel shows up. The new section is the query paramter on the end which contains an access key: `?accessKey=key`.

`https://mixer.com/TestStream123?accessKey=123456-5765ca8894b1c011e0aca1786158032e`

## Best Practices
1. Use the `/clear` chat command at the end of the stream to clear chat.
2. Keep your access key / link secure. If you need to reset it, restart the broadcast to generate a new one.
3. Double check your moderators list before using test streaming. If someone is a moderator then they can see your test stream.
4. If in doubt use a separate account.
