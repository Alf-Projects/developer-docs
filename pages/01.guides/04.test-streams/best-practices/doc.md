# Best Practices
1. Use the `/clear` chat command at the end of the stream to clear chat
2. Keep your access key / link secure. If you need to reset it, restart the broadcast to generate a new one.
3. Double check your moderators list before using test streaming. If someone is a moderator then they can see your test stream.
4. If in doubt use a separate account
