# Introduction

On Mixer, when you visit a channel page you can send messages to the channel that all the viewers and the channel owner can read. With FTL this allows a streamer to react in near real-time to chat messages as they come in.

Chat also fully supports developers, you can use our Chat APIs to get in on this action and contribute in a ton of meaningful ways to the chat experience.

## Tutorials

We currently have one chat tutorial, it shows you how to setup a basic chat bot and can be found [here](ChatBot). Try it out. If you'd like to know how to do other things with out Chat API then please open an issue](https://github.com/mixer/developer-docs/issues/new) and let us know!

## Reference Material

If you'd like to jump in and get started you can also checkout our [Chat Reference material](/reference/chat) which details how you can write your own SDK implementation.
