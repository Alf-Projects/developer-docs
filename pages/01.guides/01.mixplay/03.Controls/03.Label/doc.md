# Labels

Labels are controls which can be used to display instructions and visually group controls together. As an example, a scene with buttons that either hurt or heal the player can have each section clearly labeled respectively above the buttons.

Labels are customizable. These label properties can be edited from both the Interactive Studio and a Game Client:
1. Text displayed in the label
1. Size of the text in the label
1. Color of the text in the label
1. Whether the label is underlined
1. Whether the label is italicized
1. Whether the label is bold
