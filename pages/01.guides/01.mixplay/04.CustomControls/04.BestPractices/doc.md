## Test Across Platforms

With desktop computers as the primary development tools, it's easy to forget that most viewers aren't on desktop. Xbox and mobile viewers account for large chunks of the streaming audience. The CDK provides some tools to test on various screen sizes and resolutions, and we recommend that you also test using different browsers and different devices once your private bundle is uploaded to Mixer.

For more information about the testing and development process, see our [Workflow Guide](/guides/mixplay/customcontrols/workflow).

## Use Internationalization
Most people don't speak your native language, so most of your potential viewers or players won't either! Internationalizing your controls is an easy win to help reach the largest possible audience.

If you're using our Preact Starter, then Internationalization is already built in. [Check out the guide for that over on the Preact page](/guides/mixplay/customcontrols/gettingstartedwithpreact#internationalization).
