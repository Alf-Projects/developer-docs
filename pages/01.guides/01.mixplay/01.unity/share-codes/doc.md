By default, only you can access the Mixer functionality in your game until it is published. However, sometimes you might want to show your Mixer functionality to others. For instance, you might be demoing the Mixer functionality to a publisher. Share codes are the simplest way to allow others to see your Mixer functionality before your Mixer interactive project is published.

## Sharing an Interactive Project using Share Codes
By default, only the owner can use the project in a broadcast. This means that when you create a project, you are the only person who can broadcast the project. However, if you'd like other Mixer broadcasters to stream it, you have several options.
To manage a project's share settings, click the Share icon on the top right of the editor, as shown in the screenshot below.

You'll be presented with a dialog with three options. **Changing the sharing settings of a project will delete any previous share settings**
The first option, "Nobody can play this game until published", is the default. Selecting this option allows only the project owner to use the project in a broadcast.

The second, "Anyone with the versionId and code can play", option generates a share code. This code can be handed out to broadcasters who want to use the project in their broadcasts. These broadcasters, provide it to the Game Client which can then gain access to use the project.

## Entering your share code in Unity     
1. Open the Interactive Editor in Unity.
2. Expand the Advanced section.
3. Paste your share code in the text box and click the save button.
