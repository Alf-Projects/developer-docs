# Mixer Developer Accounts

Thanks for your interest in a Mixer Developer Account.

Mixer doesn't have any developer account status and you don't need to register for a developer account to [get started](/). Some features do require some extra steps though.

These are:
- Test Stream Access - Click [here](/guides/test-streams/) link to go to the guide for this feature.

If you're **NOT** looking for a developer account but would like to make an inquiry about our developer platform then please [Contact Us](mailto:mixerdevinfo@microsoft.com).
